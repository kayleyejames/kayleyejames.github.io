            <h2>Scripps Running Club</h2>
            <p>
                As an avid runner, I was horrified when I arrived at Scripps College and discovered there was 
                no running group in place.  I founded 
                <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/groups/159963254488649/?ref=bookmarks">Scripps Running Club</a>
                 during my second semester of college as 
                a way to meet new people and help spread the underappreciated joy of running.  In 
                our club, we emphasize body positivity and healthy living; many college-aged women struggle 
                to enjoy exercise and suffer from poor body image.  Our club demonstrates that running doesn’t 
                need to feel like a punishment and can even be a fun, social activity.  We host events every 
                few weeks, such as volleyball games and hikes, and we also register for races, including the 
                <a href = "http://runsealbeach.com/"> Run Seal Beach 10K.</a>
            </p>

            <h2><br>Weed Warriors</h2>
            <p>
                Over the summer, I participate in a group called the 
                <a href = "http://www.friendsofedgewood.org/habitat-restoration">Edgewood Weed Warriors.</a>
                    This group meets 
                weekly to remove the invasive plant species that inhabit Edgewood Park.  I grew up running on 
                Edgewood’s trails and so it’s very important to me that the park is preserved as best as it 
                can be.  While removing 
                <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaurea_solstitialis">yellow star-thistle</a>
                    and other weeds, I have learned a lot about 
                Edgewood’s ecosystem from other volunteers.  I’ve observed 
                <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_spider">lynx spiders</a>
                    protecting their young 
                and have learned which meadows the local mountain lions hunt in!  I’ve also gained a 
                lot of optimism about humankind’s impact on the world: though it seems like an impossible 
                feat to completely eradicate an invasive species from the park, older members constantly 
                remind the group of weeders’ progress in just the past ten years.

            <h2><br>Scripps Garden Club</h2>
            <p>
                My college has a community garden that grows many varieties of fruits, vegetables, 
                and herbs for students to pick and use.  The 
                <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/groups/615144388570187/">Scripps Garden Club</a>
                 plants, weeds, and tends 
                to this garden every weekend.  As a member of this club, I have helped prepare a dinner 
                made almost entirely out of our produce, built a planter bed for peas, and planted 
                different flowers and vegetables.  Garden Club is one of my favorite aspects of college 
                and it’s helped me get more involved in Scripps’ community.

            <h2><br>Spanish Language Corridor</h2>
            <p>
                During the 2018-19 academic school year, I will be living in Scripps’ Spanish Language 
                Corridor.  This hall is designed to unite Spanish-speakers and Spanish students in an 
                immersive learning opportunity.  We speak in Spanish together while learning about 
                Latin-American and Spanish cultures.
